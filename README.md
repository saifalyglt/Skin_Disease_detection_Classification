# Skin_Disease_detection_Classification
Developed an end-to-end skin lesion classification system to assist dermatologists in early detection of common skin diseases. I collected and preprocessed a diverse image dataset, then trained and fine-tuned EfficientNetB0 alongside MobileNetV2 and other CNN architectures to optimize accuracy, recall, and inference speed.
